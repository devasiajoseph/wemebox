	  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<h4>Wemebox is a hybrid content management system that sits right in between Wordpress and Hugo.</h4>
	  After working with some popular content management systems and static site builders we realized how painful it is to create and maintain a website without going through tons of guides and setup. We wanted something simple and an application which worked out of the box.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Wemebox is a product for people who want to create and deploy websites faster. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>Goals</h4>
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <b>Simple</b>
	      <p>It will take only a minute to get started with Wemebox</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>Portable</b>
	      <p>Wemebox is extremely portable if you need to move your website into a new server. Just copy the directory to the system and it will work seamlessly like before.</p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <b>Lightweight</b>
	      <p>Wemebox is optimized to use very less memory. Wemebox can run on a system with few MBs of RAM</p>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
